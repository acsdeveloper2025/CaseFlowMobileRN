A React Native mobile application for case flow management, built with TypeScript and modern development practices.

## üöÄ Features

- **Cross-platform**: iOS and Android support
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and better developer experience
- **Modern UI**: Built with NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for case summarization
- **Environment Management**: Multiple environment configurations
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks

## üìã Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Required Tools

- **Node.js**: >= 18.0.0
- **npm**: >= 8.0.0
- **Java**: 17 (for Android development)
- **Xcode**: Latest version (for iOS development)
- **Android Studio**: Latest version (for Android development)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acsdeveloper2025/CaseFlowMobileRN.git
   cd CaseFlowMobileRN
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install iOS dependencies** (iOS only)

   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The app uses environment-specific configuration files:

- `.env.development` - Development environment
- `.env.staging` - Staging environment
- `.env.production` - Production environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the required variables:

```bash
# Required
API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-url.com

# Optional
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=false
```

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete configuration details.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Development

1. **Start Metro bundler**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run the app**

   **For Android:**

   ```bash
   # Development environment
   npm run android:dev

   # Staging environment
   npm run android:staging

   # Production environment
   npm run android:prod
   ```

   **For iOS:**

   ```bash
   # Development environment
   npm run ios:dev

   # Staging environment
   npm run ios:staging

   # Production environment
   npm run ios:prod
   ```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## üîç Code Quality

The project includes automated code quality checks:

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npx prettier --write .

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks that automatically:

- Run ESLint and fix issues
- Format code with Prettier
- Run type checking

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
